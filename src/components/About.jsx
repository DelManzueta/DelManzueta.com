          Hi, Iâ€™m Del. After a long career as a visual designer, with web design
          experience, I decided to make the full transition into web
          development. My ability to translate client needs into successful
          user-centered design for print and digital products opened the door to
          web design, which lead to working directly with front-end technologies
          such as HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
        </span>
        <span>
          My interest in web development grew when I realized my natural
          creative talent was perfectly complimented with my passion for problem
          solving, allowing me to translate complex ideas into innovative
          solutions. I offer a comprehensive understanding of human
          decision-making behaviors and demonstrate the ability to work
          intuitively within cross-functional teams.
        
          Aside from my technical abilities, my strengths lie in anticipating
          uncommon issues regarding usability, and production, as well as
          performing at the highest standards, regardless of capacity and
          limitations.
